# GOG-Web-Helper

## What is this?
A Tampermonkey script with useful tools for GOG.com (like 'Augmented Steam').

## How to install?
1. Install Tampermonkey from your favourite extension store.
2. Use the raw js file 'gog-web-helper.user.js' \(click file -> choose raw\) or the [link](https://github.com/cyvb/GOG-Web-Helper/raw/main/gog-web-helper.user.js) pasted here already.
3. When the Tampermonkey asks for the permission for cross-origin access (the script accesses api.gog.com only so no need to be afraid), please allow it or functions would fail.

## What it can do at present?
- Show prices in diffrent regions.
